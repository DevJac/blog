Read, and Recommend</h1>
<h2 id="math">Math</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~simon/it.pdf">Information
Theory for Intelligent People</a> by Simon DeDeo. This is a 13 page
introduction to information theory. I first encountered entropy and
the Kullback-Leibler divergence while studying reinforcement
learning, and this paper gave me an intuitive understanding of what
they mean and made them less intimidating.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="haskell">Haskell</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html">Programming
in Haskell</a>, 2nd Edition, by Graham Hutton. I recommend starting
with this book if you already know another programming language and
want to learn Haskell. I was especially fond of Chapter 9 which
<a href=
"https://github.com/DevJac/programming_in_haskell/blob/master/src/Countdown.hs">
lead me down the rabbit hole</a> of <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting">rewriting</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://leanpub.com/thinking-with-types">Thinking with
Types</a> by Sandy Maguire. This book teaches the many language
extensions in the GHC Haskell compiler. Even if you don’t intend to
do a lot of type level programming yourself, it’s nice to know
what’s going on when you see weird squiggles and ticks in the type
signatures of libraries.</p>
