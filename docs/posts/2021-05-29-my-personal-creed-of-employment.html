<h1>My Personal Creed of Employment</h1>
<div class="authordate">May 29, 2021</div>
<p>After taking a sabbatical, a time I was very fortunate to spend
with my family and children, I was preparing to return to work. As
I walked in the park a day before I wrote these thoughts, wanting
to capture the perspective I had gained during the recent months.
This is a collection of thoughts I had at the time, I wrote them as
I walked.</p>
<p>These thoughts are incomplete and lacking context; they do not
apply to everyone, but they do apply to me and I reread them when I
become frustrated at work and they help me. They are inspired by
the good and bad times I have had in my career. They have become my
own personal creed of employment, describing the attitude and
practices I wish to follow. I hope some of them might help you.
Please interpret them charitably, some come from dark places.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stay calm. Remember, you can’t become worse off than when you
started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate a professional mindset. You are above the company,
descending to help them. Do the work required, do honest work, help
them achieve their goals, but don’t become mentally trapped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negotiate. Books can help with this. There are thousands of good
books to help develop “soft skills”, read them and use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s my moral obligation to update my resume and get it out
there at the first signs of trouble. Don’t stew over bad or unfair
situations, improve my situation, find better work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep private life private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t think adversarially. Be professional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember the feelings of others. See from their perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When leaving a company, others will feel slightly resentful
toward you, and you will feel excited because of new opportunities.
Do not be too jovial in leaving or it will damage the memories
others have of you. Empathize with them, tell them they will be
missed, show concern for them and let them see you working hard on
their behalf one last time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t half-work just to put in the hours. It’s better to give
full effort half the day and then be done. Cultivating an
ass-in-seat mentality is harmful to myself. When needed, give full
effort all day, exceed expectations and demand compensation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider doing personal projects early, before work. Give my
best self to myself, to my own projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do the bullshit. It may not make sense, it may not be right, but
the resulting respect and power may be worth it. Do the silly
certifications, compete for silly rewards, participate, have a good
attitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate with my adversaries. Help them, help them on their
turf. If a contest arises, best them on their turf. They don’t care
if I best them on my own turf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User interface matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None are above me, all are coworkers towards the company goals.
It is not my place to decide all things, it is not my place to
decide what I work on, or where I would be most valuable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t seek personal satisfaction through company projects. This
leads to frustration. Be professional, take satisfaction in helping
the company achieve its own goals, not my own. Personal projects
are for personal satisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not complain at lunch with coworkers. Do not speak about your
boss as though they are an adversary. Help your boss, they have
struggles too, they need your help. Communicate with them, ask them
how to help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciate marketing. It seems like bullshit, but it’s bullshit
I don’t want to have to do. I’m glad someone else is doing it, I’m
sincerely grateful for their efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t insist on 100% code coverage. Do make a culture of testing
available as a tool to developers. If a developer wants to write a
test to ensure their code works, make sure they have a place to put
the test, and that the test is run regularly.</p>

Thinking is work. (also)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t rewrite. Go to the problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never burn a bridge just for personal satisfaction. Avoid
burning bridges, but don’t let fear of burning bridges stop you
from doing the right thing. Especially as you get older, you only
have to maintain a good reputation until retirement age, not
forever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s your moral right to push for high compensation. Maybe even
your moral obligation. Negotiating for a high wage will help others
do the same. Keep your resume up to date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All problems should be viewed through the lens of “How does this
hinder the companies goals?” With this view, people will want to
hear your problems, but they may not choose to solve the problem
the same way you would. Management wants to know the code sucks,
but they might not choose to rewrite everything. That’s their
choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes you might think you could rewrite and manage the
product better yourself. Maybe. But then you’d be responsible for
everything: marketing, sales, customer support, front-end,
back-end, you’d have to do all that yourself. It’s not glamorous to
go it alone. Besides, there’s probably better things to work on
than rewriting whatever cruddy app you maintain at your day
job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just because people don’t think of things in the most abstract,
general, or elegant way possible doesn’t mean it’s wrong. Sometimes
you need to give people something that matches their way of
thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t sneak out at the end of the day and hope nobody asks you
about hours worked. Focus, do good work quickly, sell your work,
make sure people know your important contributions, and then face
the “hours worked” conversation with courage and good negotiating
skills. Leave no doubt that you’re a valuable memeber of the
team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you believe something may lead to problems, but nobody wants
to change, watch for the problems to occur and when they do you can
propose the change again. If no problems occur, then maybe it
wasn’t really a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be kind. There’s rarely anything you can do that is more
important than being kind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose and objective of work is to collect a paycheck by
doing honest but comfortable work, enjoy the time and effort spent
with your team, and not work too much overtime.</p>
</li>
