# Some Books I Have Read, and Recommend

## Math

- [Information Theory for Intelligent People](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~simon/it.pdf) by Simon DeDeo. This is a 13 page introduction to information theory. I first encountered entropy and the Kullback-Leibler divergence while studying reinforcement learning, and this paper gave me an intuitive understanding of what they mean and made them less intimidating.

## Haskell

- [Programming in Haskell](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html), 2nd Edition, by Graham Hutton. I recommend starting with this book if you already know another programming language and want to learn Haskell. I was especially fond of Chapter 9 which [lead me down the rabbit hole](https://github.com/DevJac/programming_in_haskell/blob/master/src/Countdown.hs) of [rewriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting).

- [Thinking with Types](https://leanpub.com/thinking-with-types) by Sandy Maguire. This book teaches the many language extensions in the GHC Haskell compiler. Even if you don't intend to do a lot of type level programming yourself, it's nice to know what's going on when you see weird squiggles and ticks in the type signatures of libraries.
